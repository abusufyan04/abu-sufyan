                <h2>Accomplishment</h2>
                <p>One of my favorite Accomplishment was getting to the  quater final of an e-sports event called Nimbus. In this project, I played an online game called Mobile Legends with my fellow teammates representing our university. It was a rewarding experience because we played against semi-pro and professional teams and were the only team representing a university that got past the qualifiers.</p>
